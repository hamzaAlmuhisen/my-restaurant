                We offer a variety of homemade dishes, featuring creamy labneh that
                is rich in protein and minerals, and topped with olive oil pressed
                from our farms in the south. The labneh is served alongside some
                tangy green olives and fiber and vitamin-rich vegetables that are
                great for keeping your heart healthy. Additionally, the main dish is
                an Arab cuisine specialty from Homs that is rich in carbohydrates,
                providing your body with the energy it needs.
